# Commerce Cloud Blob Monitor Configuration
# This service polls Azure Blob Storage for new log files and publishes events to Kafka

# Kafka Configuration
kafka:
  brokers: "localhost:9092"
  topic: "Ingestion.Blobs"
  producer_config:
    acks: "all"
    retries: 3
    retry_backoff_ms: 1000

# Global Configuration
global:
  # Default polling interval for current day monitoring (in seconds)
  polling_interval: 300  # 5 minutes
  
  # End-of-day overlap period (in minutes)
  # During this period at start of day, monitor both current and previous day
  eod_overlap_minutes: 60  # 1 hour overlap
  
  # Time zone for date calculations (important for end-of-day transitions)
  timezone: "UTC"
  
  # Blob closing detection settings
  blob_closing:
    # Enable blob closing detection
    enabled: true
    
    # Minutes without modification to consider a blob closed
    # Once closed, workers can stop polling the blob as no new data is expected
    timeout_minutes: 5

# Date Range Configuration
date_range:
  # How far back to look for missing blobs
  # Can be either:
  # - specific_date: "2025-06-01"  # Start from specific date
  # - days_back: 7                # Look back N days from today
  days_back: 3
  
  # Whether to continue monitoring current day after historical scan
  monitor_current_day: true

# Environments to Monitor
environments:
  # Development Environment
  - subscription: "cp2"
    environment: "D1"
    enabled: true
    # Override global polling interval for this environment (optional)
    polling_interval: 600  # 10 minutes for dev
    # Environment-specific selectors to monitor
    selectors:
      - "apache-proxy"
      - "api-service"
      - "backoffice"
      - "admin-interface"

  # Staging Environment
  - subscription: "cp2" 
    environment: "S1"
    enabled: true
    polling_interval: 300  # 5 minutes for staging
    selectors:
      - "apache-proxy"
      - "api-service"
      - "backoffice"
      - "background-processing"
      - "admin-interface"

  # Production Environment
  - subscription: "cp2"
    environment: "P1" 
    enabled: true
    polling_interval: 120  # 2 minutes for production
    selectors:
      - "apache-proxy"
      - "api-service"
      - "backoffice"
      - "background-processing"
      - "jsapps"
      - "imageprocessing"
      - "admin-interface"
      - "web-apps"

# Note: Blob selectors are defined in code (selectors.go)
# Available selectors: apache-proxy, api-service, admin-interface, background-processing,
# web-apps, imageprocessing, zookeeper
# The config only references them by name - implementation is in Go code

# Storage Configuration
storage:
  container_name: "commerce-logs-separated"
  
# Monitoring and Observability
monitoring:
  # Enable metrics collection
  enable_metrics: true
  
  # Log level (debug, info, warn, error)
  log_level: "info"
  
  # Report polling statistics every N iterations
  stats_report_interval: 10
  
# Error Handling
error_handling:
  # Maximum retries for Azure API calls
  max_azure_retries: 3
  
  # Backoff strategy for retries (exponential, linear, fixed)
  retry_strategy: "exponential"
  
  # Maximum delay between retries (seconds)
  max_retry_delay: 60
  
  # Continue monitoring other environments if one fails
